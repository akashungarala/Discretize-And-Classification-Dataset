# Discretize and Classification Dataset

Built a database of paintings listed on the website of an art gallery called Saatchi and extracted the structured data set into a csv file using Python. Price is taken as the decision feature and discretized it into 3 intervals. For classifiers construction, I used WEKA and applied different algorithms to choose the one that gives the highest precision and highest number of correctly classified instances.

## Platform
